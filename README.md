# AsteroidEvasion
A small 2D arcade-style game I built on my own using the Godot 3.5 engine and GDscript (a language very similar to Python).
All the assets are drawn by me and the code is original. 
This project was built to get accustomed to the engine, I did not spend much time on the menu, and the small slider is to adjust the camera zoom for different resolution as I had some problems with that.
